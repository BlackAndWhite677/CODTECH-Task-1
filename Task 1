###This Python program functions as a basic calculator. It allows users to perform simple arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Users can input two numbers and select the desired operation, and the program will compute and display the result. The program is designed to be user-friendly and efficient,
making it a handy tool for quick calculations.


def Calculator():

    print("Simple Calculator")
    print()
    x=float(input("Enter first number"))
    y=float(input("Enter second number"))

    print("1.Addition:'+'")
    print("2.Subtraction:'-'")
    print("3.Multiplication:'*'")
    print("4.Division:'/'")
    operator=input("Choose an operator symbol for addition,subtraction, multiplication or division")

    if operator=="+":
        result=x+y
        print("Sum of two numbers is",result)
    elif operator=="-":
        result=x-y
        print("Difference of two numbers is",result)
    elif operator=="*":
        result=x*y
        print("Product of two numbers is",result)
    elif operator=="/":
        if y==0:
            print("Division by zero is not possible")
        else:
            result=x/y
            print("Quotient of two numbers is",result)
    else:
        print("Invalid operator.Please choose a different operator.")
